# Multi-Agent Conversational Components

Reusable UI elements to render the results of each phase of the YSH Pre-Sale
multi-agent flow. Each phase is represented with an icon, label and container
that can display streaming content.

```tsx
<PhaseMessage phase="analysis" isLoading>
  O consumo médio mensal é de 450 kWh.
</PhaseMessage>
```

The component library is designed to be extended with additional phases or used
in other conversational interfaces.
